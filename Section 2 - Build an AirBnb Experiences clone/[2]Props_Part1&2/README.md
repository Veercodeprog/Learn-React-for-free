# Props - Understanding the Concept - Reusable Component
- Looking at the code in the ```index.js``` and ```index.html``` files in this folder, you'll see that passing additional information to our function or element allows us to reuse those function or element in multiple different ways.
- In ```React```, props will help us achieve the same thing. By creating components in ```React``` and passing ```props``` to them, we can reuse those components as many time as we want and in many different ways.

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once

	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.
