# Props - Creating a component
- If we just copy and paste a component with some harcoded data in it, we will have absolutely same components again and again. Therefore, to have the same type of component but with different data, we'll need to go to every single component and change every single piece of hardcoded data. This is not efficient at all.
- React offers us a solution to pass data to components so that we do not need to do all these above painful things while reusing our components efficiently.
- We can call the ```props``` we pass in a component ```whatever``` we want

# Notes
- The code in this lesson is just for syntax reference

## Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
