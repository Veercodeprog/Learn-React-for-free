# JSX
- What we get from JSX, or rather what React creates with JSX is just plain old JavaScript objects which describe the DOM elements that we want React to put on the page for us.
-> JSX is kinda like a function and when it runs, it returns an object that React can interpret and use to creat actual element that gets rendered on the page.
- With JSX, we need to make sure that we are only returning a single-parent element. However, we can use nested elements.
- You can save a whole bunch of JSX into a single variable and then use that variable kinda like any other variables.

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
